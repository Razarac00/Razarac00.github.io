## Professional Summary

I'm a mid-level software engineer who is well known for incredible attention to detail, beyond thorough documentation, and an uncanny ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Exceptional backend engineer (OpenAPI, Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot, Gradle, MongoDB, Kafka), experienced full stack developer (Angular, ASP .NET, C#, SQL), and earned the nickname "1 Man Ops Team" (GitOps, Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, AWS). My curiousity is unrelenting, my code actually works, my test coverage is 100%, and my cybersecurity standards have halted exploits from reaching production. A team player who's always ready to mentor and be mentored so that everyone crosses the finish line at the end of each sprint.

## Work History

### Veracode, Remote TX, USA and Remote ON, CAN
January 2022 to [Current]
Software Engineer

- Went from little to no experience with Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, and Helm to pioneering Veracode's first infrastructure and deployment strategy outside the legacy monolith.
- Onboarded multiple teams onto the Kubernetes cluster, training engineers through the use of incredibly thorough documentation, Confluence pages, Demos, paired programming, and recorded meetings.
- Regularly built microservices from the ground up in both Java and Kotlin in the Spring Boot framework with MongoDB and Kafka integrations. Minimum code coverage 100%.
- Recognized as a Security Champion who intentionally held his team to a higher security standard within a cybersecurity company, contributing Git Ops Security enhancements and setting up SAST, pipeline, and SCA scanning on all GitLab repositories.
- Brought the Veracode CLI solution over the finish line, transforming a skin and bones command line interface into a full fledged container scanning solution written entirely in Golang, released it, and carefully maintained it while bringing multiple teams up to speed on how to contribute quality code to the solution.
- Developed the first automatic AWS AMI upgrade process in the Engineering department using GitLab CICD and Linux scripting, complete with end-to-end testing and automatic upgrades in production upon success.
- Deftly analysed legacy systems, identifying and re-engineering key pieces needed for authentication and authorization for new services deployed outside legacy infrastructure, directly enabling my team to be the first team to release to production outside legacy systems.
- Consistently completed close to 1/2 of the points planned for each sprint on a team of 6-8 developers.
- Mentored Senior and Principal engineers on infrastructure development and troubleshooting, microservice development, end-to-end testing, and unit testing using Hamcrest.
